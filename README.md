# sokol-luajit

Update 06/05/2025
- Updated Discord link (Thanks DarkSeasonsStudios)
- PR added for MacOS fixes. (Thanks funatsufumiya)

TODO: Some testing on MacOS.

NOTES: Im currently very busy finishing off another project here: 

https://forum.defold.com/t/f18-interceptor-building-my-favorite-old-amiga-game/69851

Once this is complete, I will put most of my time into this project. 

Update 11/12/2024 
- Breaking changes happening. The build system works but Ive decided to change to use an FBP styled system (see FBP readme).
- I hope to have a 'usable' new system in the next couple of weeeks. 

A luajit set of ffi wrappers for the excellent sokol framework,

- [x] Win64 Binaries - samples and remotery working
- [X] Linux64 Binaries - samples and remotery working
- [x] MacOS - x86_64 Binaries - samples and remotery working
- [ ] MacOS - arm64 Binaries - tbd. Working on tests/solves.

For all things, Sokol, luajit and sokol-luajit feel free to drop in the Discord

## Sokol
The repo is based entirely on the brilliant framework here:
https://github.com/floooh/sokol

The sokol api has been built into dll's (this may change in the future) and it is executed in the best (imho) runtime system there is using its amazing ffi module:

Some of the source files have been modified to support shared libraries a little better and make the binding of ffi a little easier. There are only small changes, but this is kept in this location - do not use as a source for sokol itself.
https://github.com/dlannan/sokol

The build process builds Win, Linux, Mac OSX, IOS but not Android atm. I need to build a shared library mechansim for this to work well. Thus, the build for it currently fails.

## Luajit Sokol
The only provided main luajit binaries are for win64. 
To run other platforms, please build luajit for your platform and place in the bin/<your platform> directory.
You will also need to modify the paths at the top of the samples lua scripts to match. I will update this to be more friendly in the future (by using ffi.os).

The Wasm part of sokol might not be able to be utilized in this manner. However I do have plans to compile Luajit->wasm and embed sokol generated bytecode. It should be possible, but that is along term goal.

## Examples
I have ported examples from sokol, and will be adding more. These show how the ffi interface can be used.

How to use the example. Open a command window or powershell in the repo folder (Win64 powershell shown below)

```
PS sokol-luajit> cd .\examples\
PS sokol-luajit\examples> .\run_sample.bat cube_sapp
```

Use the run_sample bat file with one of the following parameters:
| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
|```cimgui_sapp``` | Imgui Demo example |
|```cube_sapp``` | Simple spinning cube |
|```shadow_sapp``` | Shadowed cube with moving light |
|```shapes_sapp``` | Primitive shapes spinning |
|```triangle_sapp``` | Classic triangle |
|```offscreen_sapp``` | Sphere with render texture torii? spinning on its surface. |
|```nuklear_sapp``` | Nuklear GUI demo |
|```nuklear_png_sapp``` | Nuklear example with images |
|```nuklear_multifont``` | Nuklear examples with multiple fonts and font awesome icons |
|```sdf_sapp``` | SDF from the Sokol samples |
|```remotery_cube```| A spinning cube with Remotery backend. Open /tools/remotery/vis/index.html in your browser. |

Some notes:
- There are a number of objects that must be created as pointers. In ffi the easiest way to do this is to make an array object of size 1 and this way the handle in lua is a pointer and the object access uses the array indexing.
- No performance considerations have been taken into account. These are almost direct 1 to 1 mappings of the sokol C samples to luajit samples. 
- pathing is not yet made friendly (31/10/2024 - It has been improved dramatically. Little more to do.)

Feel free to contribute or post issues/ideas comment. I put this together yesterday, and its very rudimentary atm.
