/*
    sokol_glue.h -- glue helper functions for sokol headers

    Project URL: https://github.com/floooh/sokol

    Do this:
        #define SOKOL_IMPL or
        #define SOKOL_GLUE_IMPL
    before you include this file in *one* C or C++ file to create the
    implementation.

    ...optionally provide the following macros to override defaults:

    SOKOL_ASSERT(c)     - your own assert macro (default: assert(c))
    SOKOL_GLUE_API_DECL - public function declaration prefix (default: extern)
    SOKOL_API_DECL      - same as SOKOL_GLUE_API_DECL
    SOKOL_API_IMPL      - public function implementation prefix (default: -)

    If sokol_glue.h is compiled as a DLL, define the following before
    including the declaration or implementation:

    SOKOL_DLL

    On Windows, SOKOL_DLL will define SOKOL_GLUE_API_DECL as __declspec(dllexport)
    or __declspec(dllimport) as needed.

    OVERVIEW
    ========
    sokol_glue.h provides glue helper functions between sokol_gfx.h and sokol_app.h,
    so that sokol_gfx.h doesn't need to depend on sokol_app.h but can be
    used with different window system glue libraries.

    PROVIDED FUNCTIONS
    ==================

    sg_environment sglue_environment(void)

        Returns an sg_environment struct initialized by calling sokol_app.h
        functions. Use this in the sg_setup() call like this:

        sg_setup(&(sg_desc){
            .environment = sglue_environment(),
            ...
        });

    sg_swapchain sglue_swapchain(void)

        Returns an sg_swapchain struct initialized by calling sokol_app.h
        functions. Use this in sg_begin_pass() for a 'swapchain pass' like
        this:

        sg_begin_pass(&(sg_pass){ .swapchain = sglue_swapchain(), ... });
